Good Job! You have found serious vulnerability called Command Injection!
Now, on the server you have to find 2 sepearately placed flags in the format PUTMONS{}
Depends on your expertise, both flags can vary in the difficulty.
For the first flag (on the WEB-SERVER!!!) you have to us3 lost cr3ds to c0nnect. 6omewhere. 
Ahh, apologies... we dont see any text in our notebook regarding 2nd flag.
