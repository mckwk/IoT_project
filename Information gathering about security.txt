Information gathering about security

RASPBERRY
- closing ports
- changing credentials and use strong credentials
- Using SSH
- Using a firewall
- Setting up SSH public key authentication 
- using environmental variables to store credentials to avoid hard-coded credentials
- Securing the hardware (USB port, SD card, GPIO) into a box
- Disabling Root Login and root SSH access
- (Blocking SSH brute force attacks automatically)
- Disabling OpenSSH server
- Limiting max authentication attempts (Fail2ban?)
- (Automatically Upgrading Packages)
- (Keeping the OS Updated)
- Disabling Unnecessary Services
- Making sudo Require a Password
- Using a VPN?
- Storing identifiers in a secure file with restricted permissions (.env or vault)
- requiring a password for sudo

ESP8266
- changing credentials and use strong credentials
- Using HTTPS
- Updating the firmware
- Disabling Unused Services
- Implementing a firewall
- Add a filter on the server
- Implementing a network separation?
- Disabling WPS (is it possible?)
- TLS 1.2 connection to the Raspberry (how to secure it itself?)
- Using a VPN?




DATABASE
- Securing for SQL injections with parametrical queries
- Checking about two-factor authentication, least privileges principle, data encryption, disabling root remote access 
- Limiting login attempts 




WEBSITE
- Modifying the URL of the index interface on the website
- using strong credentials
- Setting up two-factor authentication
- Limiting login attempts (firewall?)
- Encoding data on output and validating input on arrival to avoid XSS
- Using HTTP headers to avoid XSS
- Forcing HTTPS with 301 redirects and the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) directive
- Using HTTPS and SSL/TLS for login
- HttpGet -> HttpPost
- Configure security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options
- More security headers:
